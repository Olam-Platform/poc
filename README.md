# Olam Platform POC

The Olam Platform POC is using real, live sensors, which are capturing data from supply chain shipments.   

The sensors measurements are collected by a backend which saves the measurements to a traditional DB and to a smart contract
on the Ethereum Blockchain (Rinkeby Test Network).
Full history of the sensors measurements for each shipment can be viewed publicly
by reading the events emitted by the smart contract.
